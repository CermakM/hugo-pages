# Biography

I am student of CS in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, open source enthusiast and associate software engineer at Red Hat.

I like everything that is both smart and simple and yet can do complex stuff, hence AI/ML is my favourite subject. I am also very fond of Data Science and Data visualization, which I practice mainly in Python and R.

I believe that there is no progress without being open to new things, same applies to letting things being open to others.
